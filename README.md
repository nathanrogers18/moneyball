# Moneyball

In short, the goal of this assignment was to create an All-Time team of players with the highest OBP to salary ratio. 

Please see the moneyball.ipynb for the implementation.  Further assignment details are below:

## Normal
- Players with the highest OBP and the lowest salary in any specific year.

- Make sure you are removing outliers (an OBP of 1.0 is not an indicator of a perfect player, more like they possibly only played 4 or 5 games and had good luck, alternatively an OBP of 0 is pretty bad). 
- Your 9 player roster will need to include one player at each position.  
  - A player that historically played multiple positions can not account for 2 places on your roster.


## Advanced Mode
- Adjust each player's salary for inflation based on the year they earned the salary.
- Also you are required to put together an "all time best" legacy team based on their adjusted salary.
